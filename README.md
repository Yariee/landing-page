# landing-page
This is an assignment using The Odin Project, where I try to make a homepage using the box model that I have learned about previously. 
The following links are the design layout and color and fonts that I will be needing to use for this homepage to function. I will be
using HTML and CSS for this:

Design layout: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png
